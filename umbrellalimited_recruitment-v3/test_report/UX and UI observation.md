-UI is looking near as desired and I would argue that highlighting of selected cell is better in this version.
UI main concerns:
-The odd issue for Chromium is no longer occurring.
-With improved highlighting the idea for some subtle colorizing is no longer crucial but some way to improve clarity should be considered. 
-There is difference in how title of heading is presented in design and in current version. Design has bolded text which is more visible and in my opinion should be followed.
-Filter selectors look different between design and as-is. I think current choice is better as title over selector still informs user what is responsibility of said selector without adding much of empty space.
-Design uses subtler tone of gray for table. I feel current proposed design is superior for clarity of reading as of now.
-If there is only one row being displayed, "Kraj źródłowy" title is being badly aligned:

UX main concerns:
-Selectors and table are now always in one line of sight which is great improvement. 
-However new issue was clearly found when exploring web-page on mobile version.

User can't access filters easy if they scroll down the table and in my opinion it is quite UX flaw. Sadly this issue is not limited to only mobile version as it shows up on desktop version too:

-While modals for saving were disruptive, right now user has no information why their input is not accepted. As such it may be good call to have validation message show up somewhere (tooltip maybe?)
-Issue of sticky headings overlapping is fixed and in my opinion it is elegant solution.
