Story:
If I enter malformed value that contains whitespaces before or after value, it should be handled by trimming of trailing or leading whitespaces.
Steps:
1. Select cell
2. Fill out with new value that contains additional whitespaces after or before numbers
3. Value should be trimmed
4. Reload page
5. New value should be in edited cell without additional whitespaces
